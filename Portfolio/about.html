                <p><em>Jesenia is a CUNY college student majoring in Multimedia Programming, while attending school at night, she works as a part-time pharmacy staff member for Duane Reade.</em></p>

                <p><em>Born and raised in New York City, Jesenia was introduced to the Asian culture at such a young age.  She started watching Japanese Animation at the age of 6.  Born into a family of mostly male siblings, Jesenia has grown up to be a "gamer". Her gaming alias is Mai. Unlike most girls, she focused more on technology, drawing and skateboarding.  What started out as a hobby, ended up shaping her future goals as an adult.</em></p>
